			<h1>ImageUpload Class</h1><br/>
			If you've downloaded this PHP Class it means you would like to allow visitors of your website(s) to upload images to your server. Unfortunetely most enthousiast web developers don't realise the potential risks that come with this. If you don't process the files correctly, someone could (intentially or not) bring serious harm to your server (and any visitors of your website(s)). However, processing the files correctly is not so easy if you're just an enthousiast.<br /><br />
			The ImageUpload Class was developed with that in mind. If you follow the guide below, the class will do most of the difficult work for you while keeping it as simple as possible for you to use.<br /><br />
			<h3>USAGE:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Edit config.php inside the ImageUpload folder.</li>
				<li>Upload the contents of the ImageUpload folder to your server.</li>
				<li>Uploading image(s):<br /><br />
					First create your upload form:
					<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form name=&quot;upload&quot; action=&quot;upload.php&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;
	Select image to upload: &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image[]&quot; multiple&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;upload&quot; value=&quot;upload&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
					ImageUpload is designed to handle single or multiple files at once. It is however important
					that you always use the same name in the name attribute of your file input elements!<br /><br />
					So for multiple file selections:
					<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image[]&quot; multiple&gt;</code></pre>

					</pre>
					And for single file selections:
					<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image[]&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image[]&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image[]&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

					</pre>
					Secondly, you'll need to prepare your PHP form handler to use the ImageUpload class:
				<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
require_once &quot;config.php&quot;;
require_once &quot;imgupload.class.php&quot;;

$img = new ImageUpload;

$result = $img-&gt;uploadImages($_FILES['image']);</code></pre>
				The result is een object that contains any errors, messages and database table id's regarding the uploads.<br /><br />
				If you wish to test for errors:
				<pre><code class="language-php">if(!empty($result-&gt;error)){
	foreach($result-&gt;error as $errMsg){
		echo $errMsg;
	}
}</code></pre>
				If you wish to display information about each file uploaded to the visitor.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<pre>File: img1.png was succesfully uploaded!
File: img2.png was succesfully uploaded!
File: test.exe is not an image. The file is removed!
File: img3.jpg exceeds the maximum file size of: 2MB. The file is removed!
File: img4.gif was succesfully uploaded!
				</pre>
				<pre><code class="language-php">if(!empty($result-&gt;info)){
	foreach($result-&gt;info as $infoMsg){
		echo $infoMsg;
	}
}</code></pre>
				If you need the database table id's for each successful file uploaded because you want the image(s) to be embedded somewhere in your website directly:
				<pre><code class="language-php">if(!empty($result-&gt;ids)){
	foreach($result-&gt;ids as $id){
		// Do something with $id
	}
}</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>Displaying image(s):<br /><br />
					If you simply want to display the image in the browser:<br /><br />
					Browse to:
					<pre><code class="language-html">http://www.yourwebsite.com/image.php?id=1</code></pre>
					Where id is the id of the image.<br /><br />
					To show an image inside a webpage with other content:<br /><br />
					Put the following Javascript code inside your head element:
					<pre><code class="language-javascript">function load_img(element, id, style = &quot;&quot;) {
	document.getElementById(element).innerHTML='&lt;object type=&quot;text/html&quot; style=&quot;'+ style +'&quot; data=&quot;image.php?id='+ id +'&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;';
}
document.addEventListener( &quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function(){
	// Load the images after the website is loaded. Some examples:
	load_img(&quot;img&quot;, 1);
	load_img(&quot;img2&quot;, 2);
});</code></pre>
					Put div element(s) inside your webpage where you wish to display the image(s):
					<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
					If you wish to style the images (resize them for example), you'll need to style the object element that's created with Javascript:
					<pre><code class="language-javascript">load_img(&quot;img&quot;, 1, &quot;width: 300px; border: 1px solid black;&quot;);</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>Downloading image(s):<br /><br />
					Browse to:
					<pre><code class="language-html">http://www.yourwebsite.com/download.php?id=1</code></pre>
					Where id is the id of the image. The image is sent with its original filename and extension so your security won't be compromised.
				</li><br />
				<li>Deleting an image:<br /><br />
					Use the following PHP code to delete an image:
					<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
require_once &quot;config.php&quot;;
require_once &quot;imgupload.class.php&quot;;

$img = new ImageUpload;

$result = $img-&gt;deleteImage(id);

echo $result-&gt;info[0];</code></pre>
					Replace id with the id of the image.

			<h3>FAQ:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>I'm getting the error "The image cannot be displayed because it contains errors".<br />
<pre>
The ImageUpload class renames all uploaded images to a random name and changes the extension to '.tmp'. In order to correctly
display the image to the visitor, it needs to send headers towards the browser to tell it what kind of file it is and how it should handle it.
Headers however cannot be sent if there's already output sent towards the browser. And this is VERY strict! It can be as simple as some text or PHP echo,
or as difficult a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">Byte Order Marker</a> because you've edited some of the class's files with an editor that supports this.
See if your editor is able to save the file with ANSI or UTF-8 encoding without a BOM.

This is also why you should use the image.php file to retrieve the image. It was coded and saved in such a way that no output is sent towards the browser
before displaying the image.</pre>
				</li>
				<li>I'm getting the error "Unable to create htaccess file.".<br />
<pre>
Make sure that the ImageUpload class has sufficient read/write permissions to your upload directory. This directory should normally be owned by your
webserver user (apache for example) so it has all the rights nessesary. Do NOT chmod 777 the directory! This would make you vulnerable!</pre>
				</li>
				<li>I'm getting the error "The PHP fileinfo extension isn't loaded and ImageUpload was unable to load it for you.".<br />
<pre>
The ImageUpload class relies on the PHP fileinfo extension to validate the image file. If this extension isn't installed or disabled, the class can't function.
Please contact your server provider about this issue and ask them to install / enable it.</pre>
				</li>
				<li>I'm getting the error " 'file' exceeds the maximum file size that this server allowes to be uploaded!".<br />
<pre>
This means that the visitor is trying to upload a file that is larger than what is allowed by the 'post_max_size' and/or 'upload_max_filesize' settings
in your php.ini file. Either adjust the maximum file size allowed in your config.php to match the php.ini settings or edit your php.ini file to
allow larger files to be uploaded.</pre>
				</li>
				<li>I have other questions and/or suggestions about the ImageUpload class.<br />
